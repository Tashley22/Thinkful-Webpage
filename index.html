      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Tim Ashley and I'm located in Connecticut. I've spent most of my working life in the culinary industry. I thrived on the chaos of a restaurant environment, so I was understandably cautious when it came to coding. After I got my feet wet with Thinkful, however, I've caught on pretty quick and soon realized that coding is quite literally what you make of it! I look forward to being able to collaborate with other software engineers to create comprehensive projects together! </p>

        <h2>Why IT now?</h2>
      <p>One of the many reasons I am choosing to get into software development now is due to the expected demand within the industry. Take a look at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">these stats</a> to understand why now is the opportune time to develop IT skills.</p>
